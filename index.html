            <h1>London is a capital of the United Kingdom...</h1></br>
            <p>
                London, city, capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the oldest of
                the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two millennia—and
                one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest metropolis, it
                is also the country’s economic, transportation, and cultural centre.
            </p>

            <p>
                London is situated in southeastern England, lying astride the River
                Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North
                Sea. In satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen to sit
                compactly in a Green Belt of open land, with its principal ring
                highway (the M25 motorway) threaded around it at a radius of about 20
                miles (30 km) from the city centre. The growth of the built-up area
                was halted by strict town planning controls in the mid-1950s. Its
                physical limits more or less correspond to the administrative and
                statistical boundaries separating the metropolitan county of Greater
                London from the “home counties” of Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire (in
                clockwise order) to the south of the river and Buckinghamshire,
                Hertfordshire, and Essex to the north. The historic counties of Kent,
                Hertfordshire, and Essex extend in area beyond the current
                administrative counties with the same names to include substantial
                parts of the metropolitan county of Greater London, which was formed
                in 1965. Most of Greater London south of the Thames belongs to the
                historic county of Surrey, while most of Greater London north of the
                Thames belongs historically to the county of Middlesex. Area Greater
                London, 607 square miles (1,572 square km). Pop. (2001) Greater
                London, 7,172,091; (2011 prelim.) Greater London, 8,173,941.
            </p></br>
            <h2>Character Of The City</h2></br>
            <p>
                If the border of the metropolis is well defined, its internal
                structure is immensely complicated and defies description. Indeed,
                London’s defining characteristic is an absence of overall form. It is
                physically a polycentric city, with many core districts and no clear
                hierarchy among them. London has at least two (and sometimes many
                more) of everything: cities, mayors, dioceses, cathedrals, chambers of
                commerce, police forces, opera houses, orchestras, and universities.
                In every aspect it functions as a compound or confederal metropolis.
                Historically, London grew from three distinct centres: the walled
                settlement founded by the Romans on the banks of the Thames in the 1st
                century CE, today known as the City of London, “the Square Mile,” or
                simply “the City”; facing it across the bridge on the lower gravels of
                the south bank, the suburb of Southwark; and a mile upstream, on a
                great southward bend of the river, the City of Westminster. The three
                settlements had distinct and complementary roles. London, “the City,”
                developed as a centre of trade, commerce, and banking. Southwark, “the
                Borough,” became known for its monasteries, hospitals, inns, fairs,
                pleasure houses, and the great theatres of Elizabethan London—the Rose
                (1587), the Swan (1595), and the world-famous Globe (1599).
                Westminster grew up around an abbey, which brought a royal palace and,
                in its train, the entire central apparatus of the British state—its
                legislature, executive, and judiciary. It also boasts spacious parks
                and the most fashionable districts for living and shopping—the West
                End. The north-bank settlements merged into a single built-up area in
                the early decades of the 17th century, but they did not combine into a
                single enlarged municipality. The City of London was unique among
                Europe’s capital cities in retaining its medieval boundaries.
                Westminster and other suburbs were left to develop their own
                administrative structures—a pattern replicated a hundred times over as
                London exploded in size, becoming the prototype of the modern
                metropolis.
            </p></br>
            <h3>Landscape Of London</h3></br>
            <p>
                The landscape of southeastern England is shaped by an undulating bed
                of thick white chalk, consisting of a pure limestone speckled with
                flint nodules in the upper beds. Under the chalk are an incomplete
                layer of Upper Greensand (a Cretaceous rock; 65 to 145 million years
                old) and a 200-foot- (60-metre-) thick waterproof layer of Gault clay.
                Beneath them in turn lies London’s true geologic foundation, a stable
                platform of old hard rocks of Paleozoic age (about 250 to 540 million
                years old). This basement is buried nearly 1,000 feet (300 metres)
                below London, sloping away southward to depths more than 3,300 feet
                (1,000 metres) below the English Channel.
